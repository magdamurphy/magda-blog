Hey, I'm Magda and I am passionate about Product Management.

I have been exploring the ‘ingredients’ of successful product management. I love asking 'why' and I always try to have the user in mind and the outcomes that the software is meant to produce. 
I was involved in building pointless products in the past that no one wanted so I also learned the hard way! :)

This blog touches on Product Management, leadership, collaboration and software delivery based on my professional career and my MBA studies. I am writing about useful frameworks and the context they can be used in.
