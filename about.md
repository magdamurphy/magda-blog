I have been exploring the ‘ingredients’ of successful product management. I love asking 'why' and struggle to follow the rules blindly without understanding.

This blog helps me structure the things I learn about Product Management, leadership, collaboration and software delivery throughout my professional career. I am writing about useful frameworks and the context they can be used in.
