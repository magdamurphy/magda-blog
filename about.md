Hey, I'm Magda and I am passionate about Product Management!

I have been exploring the ‘ingredients’ of building successful software products from different perspectives; I started as a data geek, then became a software developer, project manager and eventually moved to manage Product. I love asking 'why' and I always try to have the user in mind and the outcomes that the software is meant to produce. 
I was involved in building pointless products in the past that no one wanted so I also learned the hard way! :) 

This blog touches on Product Management, leadership, collaboration and software delivery based on my professional career and my MBA studies. I am writing about useful frameworks and the context they can be used in.

If you have any questions or would like some help with your business, [contact me](mailto:magdalena2019@gmail.com).
